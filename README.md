# The Stadium
Second Project of the GameDevCampus workshop

### What I learned from this Project
* Build a Godot Project with 2+ levels
* Implement Lives and Health UI for the Player
* Use Event Bus to manage all the Scenes in the project
* Play sound effects along with some actions (took a hit, finished the level, game over)
* Using Player Manager to manage all the stats of the Player
* Add child node inside the EventBus using the Script only (I used the audio node inside the eventbus)
* Create Particles using GPUParticals3D
* Tween class to change the values from a property in an object back and forth

### Used Nodes
* CollisionShape3D
* MeshInstance3D
* StaticBody3D
* CharacterBody3D
* Camera3D
* Button
* Control
* Area3D
* CanvasLayer
* ProgressBar
* Label
* AudioStreamPlayer
* GPUParticles3D

### What's next
* Start a new projects with more advanced physics
* Learn about new nodes and their best practice
* Build my dream project
